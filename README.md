### Android Attendance Application

An **Android Attendance Application** is a mobile-based solution designed to streamline and automate the process of recording and managing attendance. This application allows users, typically employees, students, or participants in an event, to mark their attendance efficiently using their smartphones. The app integrates features like location-based check-ins, biometric verification (such as fingerprint or face recognition), QR code scanning, or manual input, ensuring accuracy and minimizing fraudulent entries.
